Package manager that can be used to install (ROS) dependencies

## Installation

### Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04

Standard `tue-env` installation with targets from [tue-env-targets](https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue-env-targets)

#### Installing the `tue-env`

1. Bootstrap the package manager

   For default ROS1

   <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
   ```bash
   source <(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tue-robotics/tue-env/master/installer/bootstrap.bash)  # for default ROS1
   ```
   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

   Or for ROS2

   <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
   ```bash
   source <(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tue-robotics/tue-env/master/installer/bootstrap.bash) --ros-version=2  # for ROS2
   ```
   <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

2. Install target(s)

   ```bash
   tue-get install [package_name]
   ```

3. Build sources

   ```bash
   tue-make
   source ~/.bashrc  # Or open a new terminal
   ```

### Customization

#### Virtual environment

When a new environment is created, a python virtual environment is created by default.
This can be disabled by adding `--create-virtualenv=false` to the bootstrap script.

When you want to remove the virtual environment from an existing environment, you can run:

```bash
tue-env [ENVIRONMENT] remove-venv [--purge]
```

#### Custom targets repository

A customized targets repository can be setup with this package manager (currently only one git repository is supported).
If `tue-env` is already installed, to set up the targets' repository run:

```bash
tue-env init ENVIRONMENT DIRECTORY --targets-url=<targets_repo_git_url>
```

This will do the same as running the commands separately:

```bash
tue-env init ENVIRONMENT [DIRECTORY] # Will not result in an environment being loaded. Unless one was already loaded before
tue-env init-targets [ENVIRONMENT] <targets_repo_git_url> # The environment arg is required, when no environment is loaded
```

else first setup `tue-env` by manually following the procedure in the bootstrap
script.

You can also set the targets' repository in the initial setup by providing it as an argument of the bootstrap script.
Add `--targets-repo=<targets_repo_git_url>` as argument, this can be any type of url supported by git.

When a targets' repository is already initialized.
It can be switched by running the same `init-targets` command.
This will rename the old targets folder with a timestamp and clone the new targets repo in place.

#### Custom repository list

Various utility commands use `_tue-repos-do` to execute a command in all repositories.
By default, this command will execute the command in all repositories in the `tue-env` workspace.
This can be changed by setting the `TUE_ENV_REPOS_DO_DIRS` environment variable to a list of repositories folders.
This can be done by adding the setting it with:

```bash
tue-env config [environment] set TUE_ENV_REPOS_DO_DIRS PATH1:PATH2:PATH3
# Also possible to use variables in the paths, the variable needs to be single quoted
tue-env config [environment] set TUE_ENV_REPOS_DO_DIRS '${TUE_ENV_REPOS_DIR}'/some/path:'${HOME}'some/other/path
```

#### Add an SSH key to GitHub to gain access to this repository

Add the public part of your ssh-key (`cat ~/.ssh/<KEY_NAME>.pub`,
where `<KEY_NAME>` is the name of your ssh-key) to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys and `New SSH key`

To generate a new ssh keypair:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ssh
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519
cat ~/.ssh/<KEY_NAME>.pub
```

## Usage

With `tue-get` you can install various targets which mostly are ros packages.
The list of default packages can be seen [here](https://github.com/tue-robotics/tue-env-targets).

```bash
tue-get install <TARGET_NAME>
```

For example, to install a default development installation for working with
TU/e robots, run the following command:

```bash
tue-get install tue-dev  # For TU/e robots(Amigo & Sergio)
# Or
tue-get install hero-dev  # For Hero
```

**Note:** Any ROS package, which has a source installation must be built.
In the current implementation of `tue-get` this doesn't happen automatically.
However, we provide an alias to `catkin build`/`colcon build` as `tue-make` which would build the `tue-env` workspace.

Upon executing the installation instructions mentioned in the previous section, `~/.tue/setup.bash` is automatically
added in `.bashrc`. Sourcing `.bashrc` would make `tue-env` available to the bash session.

### Pre-built docker images

This repository provides various pre-built docker images.
To use them, first install the docker target (`tue-get install docker`).
A list of ready to use docker images generated by this repository can be found
[here](https://github.com/orgs/tue-robotics/packages)

## Different environments

To isolate builds, you can use different environments.
Each environment will contain a different copy of the repositories used.
These environments can also be useful to separate ROS1 from ROS2 installations.

To initialize a new environment (for example, the Pico robot):

```bash
mkdir ~/ros/pico && tue-env init pico ~/ros/pico
```

Now to switch to this environment and install a package, you can:

```bash
tue-env switch pico
tue-get install ros-pico
```

Or use `tue-env set-default` if you want this to be the default.

## Guidelines on creating a new target

The targets directory is located at `.env/targets` relative to the root of the environment directory.
The target directory of each environment can be accessed by:

```bash
tue-env targets # Will change the directory to the targets directory of the current environment
# or
tue-env targets <environment> # Will change the directory to the targets directory of the specified environment
```

The targets directory contains a list of targets. Each target is a directory with the name of the target.

A target can consist of the following files:

1. `install.yaml`
2. `install.bash`
3. `setup`
4. `.ci_ignore/.ci_ignore_bash/.ci_ignore_yaml`

Installation happens in the above order. First `install.yaml` is parsed and the
instructions in it are executed. Then `install.bash` is executed. This must have
commands/instructions that cannot be specified in the YAML file. Lastly, the
`setup` file is sourced in the bash environment by `setup.bash` of `tue-env`.

Any target dependencies that can be specified in `install.yaml` as other targets
or installable packages must be specified there. They should not be moved to
`install.bash` as `tue-env` has many controls in place to parse the YAML file.

Some (parts of) targets are not used for testing, but do take a long time
to install. Therefore, it is preferable to skip these (parts of) targets during CI.
To ignore an entire target in CI, add a `.ci_ignore` file to the target. To either
ignore the bash script or the YAML file add respectively `.ci_ignore_bash` or `.ci_ignore_yaml`.

### Naming conventions

Name of the target must start with `ros-` only if it is a `catkin`/`colcon` (ROS) package.
It's `install.yaml` file must be in the format of [ROS target](#ros-package-install).

### Writing `install.yaml`

| Symbol | Convention                             |
|--------|----------------------------------------|
| []     | Alternate options                      |
| <>     | Input argument required with the field |

Some fields are mentioned to be optional.

Taking the above into account, the following combinations for `install.yaml` are possible:

#### ROS package install

1. From source

   ```yaml
   - type: ros
     source:
       type: git
       url: <Repository URL>
       sub-dir: <Sub directory of the repository> (Optional field)
       version: <Version to be installed> (Optional field)
   ```

2. From system

   ```yaml
   - type: ros
     source:
       type: system
       name: <Package name>
   ```

3. Depending on ROS distro

   ```yaml
   - type: ros
     default:
       source:
         type: system
         name: <Package name>
     melodic:
       source:
         type: git
         url: <Repository URL>
     noetic:
       source: null
   ```

Both ROS distro specific as default can be 'null'.
Preferred usage is default for current and feature distributions and exceptions for old distributions.

##### ROS package source removal

When switching from a source installation to a system installation, the source installation must be removed.
This can be done by adding a `ros-remove-source` target to the `install.yaml` file.
It removes the package from the workspace, including uninstalling.
It checks whether there are still references to the repository in the workspace,
otherwise it will delete the repository as well.

```yaml
- type: ros-remove-source
  source:
    type: git
    url: <Repository URL>
    eol: <End of life date>
    path: <Directory of the cloned repository> (Optional field)
```

Again, this can be distro-specific.

```yaml
- type: ros-remove-source
  default:
    source:
      type: git
      url: <Repository URL>
      eol: <End of life date>
      path: <Directory of the cloned repository> (Optional field)
  noetic:
    source: null
```

#### Catkin package install

```yaml
- type: catkin
  source:
    type: git
    url: <Repository URL>
    sub-dir: <Sub directory of the repository> (Optional field)
    version: <Version to be installed> (Optional field)
```

This target type is similar to a ROS source target with only difference being a catkin package is independent of any ROS
dependencies and solely depends on catkin.

#### Target / System / PIP / PIP3 / PPA / Snap / Gem / DPKG / Empty

```yaml
- type: [target/system/pip/pip3/ppa/snap/gem/dpkg/empty]
  name: <Name of the candidate>
```

Depending on Ubuntu distribution:

```yaml
- type: [target/system/pip/pip3/ppa/snap/gem/dpkg/empty]
  xenial:
    name: [null/<Name of the candidate>]
  default:
    name: [null/<Name of the candidate>]
```

Both the Ubuntu distribution specific as default can be 'null'.
Preferred usage is default for current and feature distributions and exceptions for old distributions.

#### (Target / System / PIP / PIP3 / PPA / Snap / Gem)-now

The default installation method for targets of type `system`, `pip(3)`, `ppa`, `snap` and `gem` is to collect all such
targets in a list and install them simultaneously at the end of the `tue-get install` procedure.
To install such a dependency immediately for a specific target, use the target type as `X-now`:

```yaml
- type: [target/system/pip/pip3/ppa/snap/gem]-now
  name: <Name of the candidate>

- type: [target/system/pip/pip3/ppa/snap/gem/dpkg]
  name: <Name of the candidate>
```

`target-now` will install a target directly recursively.
So also all its dependencies will be installed directly, by converting them from `XX` to `XX-now`.
Except `ROS` and `DPKG` are excluded.
ROS dependencies are excluded because ROS packages should only be used at runtime,
because it requires either a compilation and/or resourcing the workspace.
It is preferred to include these `-now` dependencies in `install.yaml`.
Only use the corresponding bash function in `install.bash` if no other solution is possible.

#### GIT

```yaml
- type: git
  url: <url>
  path: [path/where/to/clone] (Optional field)
  version: [branch/commit/tag] (Optional field)
```

#### APT-KEY-SOURCE(-now)

Add an APT source including the key which it is signed with.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```yaml
- type: apt-key-source
  distribution-extensions: [<ext1>, [<ext2>, ..., <extN>]] (Minimal one extension required, use "" for no extension, just distribution name)
  key-file: </absolute/path/where/to/store/key>
  key-fingerprint: <fingerprint>
  key-url: <url>
  repo-components: [[<component1>, ..., <componentN>]] (Optional field)
  repo-url: <url>
  source-file: </absolute/path/to/source.list> or <relative path of source.list to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/>
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

### Writing `install.bash`

The use of the following variables is prohibited in `install.bash`:

- `TUE_APT_GET_UPDATED_FILE`
- `TUE_ENV*`
- `TUE_INSTALL_*`
- `install_file`
- `now`
- `old_deps`
- `parent_target`
- `state_file`
- `state_file_now`
- `target`
- `target_processed`

#### Generic `tue-install` functions

The following functions provided with `tue-env` must be preferred over any
generally used methods of installing packages:

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The input arguments for each of the above-mentioned commands can be found by
simply executing the command in a bash session (provided `tue-env` is correctly
installed).

A general remark about the preferred order of the package repositories:

system > ppa > apt-key-source > pip = pip3 > snap > gem > git > dpkg

#### Logging

The following logging functions can be used:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
| Function Name         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
